This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python:
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Properties and error handling
-
-  Assignment 1: Book Class with Inheritance
- `Book`, `EBook`, `Audiobook` classes
- Encapsulation using `@property`
- Type hints and error handling

 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
Animals with different `move()` behaviors:
- `Dog`: Running 
- `Snake`: Slithering 
- `Bird`: Flying
